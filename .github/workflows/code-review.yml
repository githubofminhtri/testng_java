      # 2. Set up JDK 17

          cache: 'maven' # Caches dependencies for faster builds

      # 3. Build with Maven and run tests
      # This command compiles the code, runs tests, and packages the application.
      # The build will fail if any tests fail, blocking the PR.
      - name: Build and Test with Maven
        run: mvn -B package --file pom.xml

      # 4. (Optional) Run Checkstyle for code style analysis
      # This requires you to have the Checkstyle plugin configured in your pom.xml
      - name: Run Checkstyle
        run: mvn checkstyle:check

      # 5. (Optional) Run CodeQL for security analysis
      # CodeQL scans for common security vulnerabilities in your code.
